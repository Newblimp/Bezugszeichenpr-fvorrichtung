# Bezugszeichenprüfvorrichtung

This is a small software I wrote to keep track of reference signs assigned to terms in patent applications. It will check if all the numbers are correct.
The software deals with plurals and different cases using the Oleander stemming library.
multi term words are also supported for terms composed with two words (right click -> enable multi-word mode)

Wrong definite/indefinite articles are highlighted cyan, wrong reference signs yellow
